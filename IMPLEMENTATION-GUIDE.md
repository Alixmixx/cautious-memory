Core Implementation Strategies and Best Practices
This section provides a detailed, practical guide for implementing each component of the recommended architecture.

4.1. Setting Up Your Monorepo with Turborepo
Using a monorepo is an excellent choice for this project, as it simplifies dependency management and code sharing between your frontend and backend. Turborepo is a high-performance build system for JavaScript and TypeScript codebases, making it a perfect fit.
1. Initialize Your Monorepo: Start by creating a new Turborepo project.
Bash
npx create-turbo@latest my-ai-app

2. Structure Your Project: Organize your monorepo with separate applications and shared packages. This structure promotes code reuse and a clean separation of concerns.
/my-ai-app
|-- /apps
|   |-- /api          // Your NestJS backend application
|   |-- /web          // Your React/Next.js frontend
|-- /packages
|   |-- /ui           // Shared React components (e.g., buttons, modals)
|   |-- /eslint-config-custom
|   |-- /tsconfig     // Shared TypeScript configuration

3. Generate Supabase Types: Leverage the Supabase CLI to generate TypeScript types from your database schema. Store these in a shared package to use them in both your frontend and backend, ensuring end-to-end type safety.
First, link your project to Supabase:
Bash
npx supabase login
npx supabase link --project-ref <your-project-ref>

Then, generate the types:
Bash
npx supabase gen types typescript --linked > ./packages/tsconfig/database.types.ts


4.2. Backend (NestJS) Implementation
Your NestJS backend will act as the central nervous system of your application, orchestrating all the services.
Supabase Integration (The "Supabase-first" Way)
Instead of a traditional ORM, you'll use the supabase-js client directly. This approach fully leverages Supabase's built-in features like RLS and real-time capabilities.
1. Create a Dedicated SupabaseModule: Create a module to provide an injectable Supabase client to the rest of your application. This makes it easy to manage your Supabase connection and use it in any service.
TypeScript
// /apps/api/src/supabase/supabase.module.ts
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { SupabaseService } from './supabase.service';

@Module({
  providers: [SupabaseService],
  exports: [SupabaseService],
})
export class SupabaseModule {}

// /apps/api/src/supabase/supabase.service.ts
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { createClient, SupabaseClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';
import { ConfigService } from '@nestjs/config';

@Injectable()
export class SupabaseService {
  private supabase: SupabaseClient;

  constructor(private configService: ConfigService) {
    this.supabase = createClient(
      this.configService.get<string>('SUPABASE_URL'),
      this.configService.get<string>('SUPABASE_KEY'),
    );
  }

  getClient(): SupabaseClient {
    return this.supabase;
  }
}

2. Implement a Custom AuthGuard: Your frontend will send a JWT in the Authorization header. This guard will intercept incoming requests, extract the token, and validate it with Supabase.
TypeScript
// /apps/api/src/auth/supabase-auth.guard.ts
import { Injectable, CanActivate, ExecutionContext } from '@nestjs/common';
import { SupabaseService } from '../supabase/supabase.service';

@Injectable()
export class SupabaseAuthGuard implements CanActivate {
  constructor(private readonly supabaseService: SupabaseService) {}

  async canActivate(context: ExecutionContext): Promise<boolean> {
    const request = context.switchToHttp().getRequest();
    const token = request.headers.authorization?.split(' ')[1];

    if (!token) {
      return false;
    }

    const { data: { user }, error } = await this.supabaseService.getClient().auth.getUser(token);

    if (error || !user) {
      return false;
    }
    
    request.user = user; // Attach user to the request object
    return true;
  }
}

3. Use Row Level Security (RLS) for Authorization: RLS is Supabase's superpower. It allows you to define security policies directly in your database. When your NestJS backend makes a request to Supabase with the user's validated JWT, Supabase will automatically enforce these policies.
Example RLS Policy: Users can only see their own projects.
SQL
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own projects."
ON projects FOR SELECT
USING (auth.uid() = owner_id);

Orchestrating Long-Running Jobs with BullMQ
For tasks like image generation that can take several minutes, a job queue is essential. BullMQ is a robust and fast option that integrates well with NestJS.
1. Set up BullMQ in NestJS: Use the @nestjs/bullmq package to configure your queues. Your main API will act as a producer, adding jobs to the queue.
TypeScript
// In your image generation module
@Injectable()
export class ImageGenerationService {
  constructor(@InjectQueue('image-generation') private readonly imageGenerationQueue: Queue) {}

  async generateImage(prompt: string, userId: string) {
    await this.imageGenerationQueue.add('generate', {
      prompt,
      userId,
    });
  }
}

2. Create a Separate Worker Process: A dedicated worker process will listen for and process jobs from the queue. This prevents long-running tasks from blocking your main API.
TypeScript
// /apps/api/src/image-generation/image-generation.processor.ts
@Processor('image-generation')
export class ImageGenerationProcessor extends WorkerHost {
  async process(job: Job<any, any, string>): Promise<any> {
    const { prompt, userId } = job.data;
    
    // 1. Call the ComfyUI API to start the image generation
    const result = await this.comfyuiService.generateImage(prompt);

    // 2. Upload the generated image to Supabase Storage
    await this.supabaseService.uploadImage(result.image, userId);
    
    // 3. Update the database with the image URL
    // ...
  }
}

Managing the ComfyUI Docker Container
Your NestJS backend can programmatically manage the ComfyUI Docker container using the dockerode library. This is useful for restarting the container or checking its status.
TypeScript
// /apps/api/src/docker/docker.service.ts
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import * as Docker from 'dockerode';

@Injectable()
export class DockerService {
  private docker: Docker;

  constructor() {
    this.docker = new Docker();
  }

  async restartComfyUIContainer() {
    const container = this.docker.getContainer('comfyui'); // Use your container name
    await container.restart();
  }
}

Handling NFS for Model Storage
The NFS share will be mounted on the host system where your NestJS application and the ComfyUI Docker container are running.
ComfyUI Container: The NFS share will be mounted as a volume in the ComfyUI container's models directory.
NestJS Backend: Your NestJS application can interact with the NFS share as if it were a local directory using the native Node.js fs module. This is useful for listing available models or performing other file system operations.

4.3. Frontend (React/Next.js) Implementation
Your Next.js frontend will handle the user interface and interact with your NestJS backend.
1. Authentication with Supabase: Use the @supabase/ssr library to handle authentication. This library simplifies server-side rendering and manages the authentication state, including setting the JWT in an httpOnly cookie.
2. Communicating with the NestJS Backend: Use a library like axios to make API calls to your NestJS backend. You'll need to configure it to send the Supabase JWT with each request.
TypeScript
// Example API client in your frontend
import axios from 'axios';
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';

const supabase = createClient(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL, process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY);

const apiClient = axios.create({
  baseURL: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL,
});

apiClient.interceptors.request.use(async (config) => {
  const { data: { session } } = await supabase.auth.getSession();
  if (session?.access_token) {
    config.headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${session.access_token}`;
  }
  return config;
});

export default apiClient;

3. Uploading Files to Supabase Storage: For large files, it's best to avoid proxying them through your NestJS server. Instead, get a signed URL from your backend and upload the file directly from the client to Supabase Storage.
Step 1 (Frontend): Request a signed URL from your NestJS backend.
Step 2 (Backend): The NestJS backend uses the supabase-js client to generate a signed URL and sends it back to the frontend.
Step 3 (Frontend): The frontend uses the signed URL to upload the file directly to Supabase Storage.

4.4. Integrating External AI APIs (Gemini/OpenAI)
Create dedicated modules in your NestJS backend for each external AI provider. Use the NestJS ConfigService to securely manage API keys.
TypeScript
// /apps/api/src/openai/openai.service.ts
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { ConfigService } from '@nestjs/config';
import OpenAI from 'openai';

@Injectable()
export class OpenAIService {
  private openai: OpenAI;

  constructor(private configService: ConfigService) {
    this.openai = new OpenAI({
      apiKey: this.configService.get<string>('OPENAI_API_KEY'),
    });
  }

  // ... methods to interact with the OpenAI API
}

5. Step-by-Step Development Roadmap
Here is a high-level roadmap to guide you through the development process:
